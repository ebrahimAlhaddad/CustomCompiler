# CustomCompiler
Program compiles special coding langauge into assembly level code. It supports limited number of functions.
Regular Expressions generated by an external tool are used to parse lines of code. 
A node tree is used to track parsed expressions and generate assembly code in order.
Infinitely generated registers (virtual registers) are used in generating the initial assembly file,
virtual registers are replaced with real register names using interval tracking.
